research_summary : "we can address the problem of information overload in a target domain by enhancing the semantic similarity between the target domain and an auxiliary domain without information overload problem."
research_dumbed_summary : "without information overload problem."
research_area: "focuses on an emerging sub-discipline of recommender systems know as cross-domain recommender systems."
research_main_idea : "to enhance the semantic similarity between recommendation domains."
research_aim : "to investigate the use of collective matrix factorization in addressing the sparsity and cold start problem in cross-domain scenarios by enhancing the knowledge transfer process with semantically related tags."
research_motivation : "the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and IoT gateways that cover diverse heterogeneous recommendation domains that can benefit from cross-domain recommender approaches."
research_most_interesting_aspect : "Developing the different theoretical cross-domain recommender models in the thesis into computer programs using the right data structures and algorithms to create reproducible experiments"
research_most_enjoyed_aspect : "Getting a consensus with the supervisory team after putting forward the idea of cross-domain recommender problem "
research_suprised : "The research findings contrast the assumption that recommendation accuracy of cross-domain recommender system depends of the size of overlapping features existing across the domains."
research_change_progression : "Cross-domain models can be extended and progressing from item rec. to POI rec. by integrating contextual parameters such as location to the models was eye-opening"
research_phd_lessons : "becoming a sound researcher with the right skill to identify a problem and develop solution is more satisfying"
research_newresearcher_advice : "the new solutions cross-domain recommenders bring to the table make their complex models worth the studying. Also to remember to take study breaks as often as it is possible for them."
research_problem_identification : "there are currently no research efforts in tag-based cross-domain recommender systems that consider the semantic relationship between social tags that are not common/shared across domains."
research_strongest_influence : "The strongest influence in the field of cross-domain recommender systems are [Paolo Cremones] (https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=dTSOPCMAAAAJ&hl=en), [Iván Cantador] (https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=iCMJ360AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ignacio Fernández-Tobıas] (https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=qskMTlMAAAAJ&hl=en)."
research_most_important_papers : " [Enrich et al. (2013)] (https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/24065387.pdf) and  [Fernández-Tobías and Cantador (2014)] (http://http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~cantador/doc/2014/cbrecsys14.pdf)."
research_primary_definition : "Recommender systems are systems that alleviate the information overload problem by guiding users in a personalised way through a set of items."
research_secondary_definition : "Cross-domain recommendation is a new field in recommender systems. Conventional recommender systems utilizes attributes in a single domain for recommendation, cross-domain recommender systems considers attributes in two or more domains."
research_most_recent_developments : "Recent development in Cross-domain recommendation use deep learning methods in recommendation settings that involve knowledge transfer across domains."
research_key_decisions : "Extending current tag-based cross-domain recommender model to include additional parameters rather than increasing overlapping domain features."
research_experimental_design : "on a 10 fold cross-validation, with the models' performance taken as an average across all 10 folds."
research_methodology : "use the approach of transferring domain knowledge through shared domain features was adopted."
research_methodology_options : "An alternative set of methods to transferring domain knowledge is aggregating domain knowledge, which involves merging user preferences into a unified model."
research_methodology_options_advantage : "In contrast to methods of aggregating domain knowledge, methods of transferring domain knowledge have the advantage of not requiring items or users to overlap across the domains."
research_ethical_issues : "to protect privacy and adhere to ethical guidelines."
research_dataset : "Datasets from two different online rating systems were used to represent a target and an auxiliary domain. 1. MovieLens 10M and 2. LibraryThing 700K."
research_evaluation : "were evaluated based on how well they accurately estimate ratings that users will give to items they are yet to utilise."
research_evaluation_correct : "benchmarked against other state-of-the-art cross-domain recommender models for reliability."
research_strongest : "the extension of the concept of cross-domain recommendation to the field of POI recommendations."
research_weakest : "evaluating the proposed model on datasets from two application domain as limiting. Dataset from multiple domains are are one of the challenges in cross-domain recommendation."
research_improvement :  "to take account of memory and time complexity is an aspect of the research work that requires improvement."
research_summarise_finding : "recommendation accuracy of tag-based cross-domain recommender models can be improved by accounting for the influence of semantically related tags across recommender domains."
research_finding_literature_relation : "support the consensus in literature that prediction accuracy is generally lower for a cross-domain recommender set up where the domain with more number of features is used as the target domain."
research_empirical_practical_implications : "system should decide in advance whether the dataset from an auxiliary domain is worth being exploited for a cross-domain recommendation."
research_phd_interests : "integrate IoT and autonomous devices will find the improved recommender accuracy "
research_phd_publication : "the methods and results of extending cross-domain recommendation to the field of POI recommendations in a peer reviewed journal."
research_question1 : "RQ1 - Can a cross-domain recommender model perform better when the intersect between set of tags in a target and auxiliary domain increases?"
research_question2 : "RQ2 - Can semantically related tags improve the performance of cross-domain recommender model when they are included as additional parameters to the model?"
research_question3 : "RQ3 - Can performance of a multi-category POI recommender be improved by incorporating category similarity as context into the model?"
research_contribution1 : "adding semantically related tags to the number of shared tags between domains did not result in a significant difference in accuracy of predicted ratings."
research_contribution2 : "showed that modelling the influence of both unique tags and semantically related tags improves rating prediction accuracy in tag-based cross-domain recommender systems."
research_contribution3 : "the effect of including category similarity as contextual information to multi-category POI ranking model for improved POI recommendation score and performance."
research_futurework1 : "open up new topics such as using larger lexical knowledge-base (e.g. DBpedia) in computing the semantic similarity of features across domains."
research_futurework2 : "finding out the adequacy of an auxiliary domain before it is used in tag-based cross-domain recommender systems."
research_futurework3 : "further studies need to be carried to understand application of the approaches to Next-POI recommender systems."

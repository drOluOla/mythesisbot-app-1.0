MyThesisbot was created by Oluseyi Olarewaju after completing his PhD in Computer Science and desiring to share a summarised version of his research work. Most importantly, the bot has been made open source by Oluseyi to encourage other interested researchers to customise it with the content of their research work. 

This bot was built using [Rasa Open Source](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa) conversational platform.
